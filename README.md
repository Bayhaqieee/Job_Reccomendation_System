# What is the Difference?

- My Version is only implementing Local Server system using streamlit, but further development can be Improved later!
- The dataset that used is being modified to my focus, since i found the latest repo that the dataset URL for Web Scraping is not Functioning anymore or the structure if the Glassdoor websites has been entirely changed, so i changing the whole dataset to be able to be created with a Generator within our demanded parameters, Currently i am generating jobs dataset on Indonesian Cities and Indonesian Companies (Indonesia Mentioned KRRRRAAAAHHHHHH 🇮🇩🇮🇩🇮🇩🦅🦅🦅🦅🔥🔥🔥)
- This system not only gives you recommendations based on your CV, but it will also advise positions depending on where you are now living; the system will require where city you are in / the closest you are to.
- I've added the streamlit styling folder (.streamlit), which you can freely change.
- Removing the web scrapping capability, as my current goal is to develop a job recommendation system as efficient and precise as possible.
- Fixing the Upload system, on Abbas repo, I discovered that the Upload system on the interface is not working and that the system needs to change the CV Path on a regular basis to read my CV, thus by adjusting the CV uploading system, the system can receive and read the cv without changing the system path.
- Removing some Unnecessary Folder needed for my system
